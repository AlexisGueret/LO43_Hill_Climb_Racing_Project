# LO43_Hill_Climb_Racing_Project
 Project done for the "Basics of OOP" course with the help of Meriadeg Guichard
 
 This project is an Hill climb racing game where you have to get to the end of each level without crashing and without running out of gas.
 We worked with Java and the LibGDX game development framework.
 
You will find a video of the game here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmR3gL00w8E&ab_channel=AlexisGueret
